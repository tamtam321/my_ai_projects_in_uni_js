# my_ai_projects_in_uni_js
These tasks were given during my artificial intelligent class. Each task was about to write an algorithm which help for our agent to find a path to reach the goal. At the first task there is an open map, the agent could see everything and with this circumstance it has to reach the goal. At the second it couldn't see the whole map and it has a vision limitation. At the last one the vision constraint is still on but now there are also traps which should be considered during findind the path. Each framework folder contains an environment html file. If you run it on a live server e.g. in visual studio code with live server extension you can test my code, just select a track and "Code play" mode, after that give a name for the agent and copy my code below that in the code field and then click "Start!". You will see how my agent operates based on the code. In the folder there is my_code_en.js file which contains my solution and has english comments int to explain things. Also there is a pdf file which was may task description.
